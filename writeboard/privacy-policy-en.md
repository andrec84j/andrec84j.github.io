# Privacy Policy - Writeboard

**Last Updated:** January 13, 2026

**Writeboard** ("we", "our", or "app") is digital whiteboard and screenshot software developed with a focus on privacy and local storage. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage

### 1.1 Local Data
Writeboard is a **Local-First** application. This means that:
*   All screenshots, drawings, diagrams, and notes are stored **exclusively on your device**.
*   We do not send your files, images, or projects to our servers.
*   Application settings are saved locally in the installation folder or the operating system's user data directory.

### 1.2 AI (Artificial Intelligence) Data
To offer advanced features such as optical character recognition (OCR), text improvement, and diagram generation, the application may interact with third-party services (such as OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, etc.), **if configured by the user**.
*   **API Keys:** You use your own API keys. They are stored locally on your device in an encrypted form (where possible) or in local configuration files.
*   **Data Submission:** When using an AI feature, only the text or image strictly necessary for that specific request is sent to the chosen AI provider.
*   **No Training:** We do not use your data to train our models. The use of data by AI providers (OpenAI, Google, etc.) is governed by their respective privacy policies.

## 2. Device Permissions

The application may request the following permissions to function correctly:
*   **Screen Recording:** To perform screenshots and video recordings of the desktop.
*   **File System Access:** To save and read your projects, export images, and read configuration files.
*   **Microphone (Optional):** Only if you use audio recording features or voice notes, if available.

## 3. Licensing and Activation

To verify the validity of your license (Pro version), the application may perform a minimal local or online check (key validation only). No personal data is linked to this check beyond the license status.

## 4. Data Sharing

We **do not sell, rent, or share** your personal data or content created with third parties. Since the data resides on your device, you have full control over how and with whom to share it (for example, by sending an exported image via email).

## 5. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We recommend that you review this document regularly to stay informed about how we protect your information.

## 6. Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through our official repository or support channel.
